We released Version 0.8.0 of our Python Library.

For details of what's new, see [the changelog](https://github.com/DataTig/DataTig/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#080---2025-05-16)

This includes a new design for the websites it produces - and that design was rolled out to all our other websites at the same time.
